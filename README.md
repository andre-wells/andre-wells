## About Me

I've been engineering software since 2006, starting out in the Oil and Gas industry with the bulk of my experience in the Legal industry.  In 2015 I became the project leader of a product that generates and automates court documents, manages tasks and limitation dates and integrates into various legal practice management suites.

I am currently work at [Korbicom](https://www.korbicom.com/) as the Project Lead and Lead Developer of a [document automation system](https://www.korbitec.ca/), architecting solutions and coordinating development efforts with other team members.

I have extensive experience in desktop application development but I'm currently most interested in server side development using [.NET Core and .NET 5.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/).
