## About Me

I've been engineering software since 2009, starting out in the Oil and Gas industry with the bulk of my experience in the Legal industry.  In 2015 I became the project leader of a product that generates and automates court documents, manages tasks and limitation dates and integrates into various legal practice management suites.

I am the technical lead; architecting solutions and coordinating development efforts with other team members. I manage four software developers (two of them seniors) and one tester which involves 
- Planning and estimations
- Orchestrating work effort, delegation and assignment
- Coaching and developing team members
- Recruitment, training and retention
- Assisting in engineering and problem solving
- Establishing and enforcing practices and processes for the team

I have extensive experience in desktop application development but I'm currently most interested in server side development using [.NET Core and .NET 5.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/).
