### About Me

I've been engineering software since 2009, starting out in the Oil and Gas industry with the bulk of my experiance in the Legal industry.  In 2015 I became the project leader of a product that generates and automates court documents, manages tasks and limitation dates and integrates into various legal practice management suites.  

I am the technical lead; architecting solutions and coordinating development efforts with other team members. I manage four software developers (two of them seniors) and one tester which involves 
- Planning and estimations
- Orchestrating work effort and delegation
- Coaching and developing team members
- Recruitment, training and retention
- Assisting in engineering and problem solving.
- Establishing practices and processes for the team to follow.

I have extensive experiance in desktop application development but I'm curretly most interested in server side development using ![.NET Core and .NET 5.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/).

### Skills

- C# in the .NET Framework, .NET Core and .NET 5 frameworks.
- Clean Architecure and Test Driven Development
